# Burger-Tracker - [View site](https://gentle-wave-65491.herokuapp.com/)
My Burger App is an application that allows you to track hamburgers that you have eaten.
It was completed as a final project for the Software Engineering Immersive course through
General Assembly.  The app is deployed to Heroku at: https://gentle-wave-65491.herokuapp.com/ The app utilizes the following technologies:
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Bulma CSS Framework
+ MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angularjs, Node.js)

As part of the project we were tasked with learning a new technology.  Given that I enjoy Front-End development,  I decided to learn Bulma(CSS Framework) and it worked out very well.  Bulma is a very intuitive framework that is very easy to use!  In addition to this, it had great documentation - which always helps!

## User Stories
* User can add a new burger (Create)
* User can see all burger entries (Read)
* User can update a previous burger entry (Update)
* User can delete a burger (Delete)

##Logo Creation
The hamburger logos were created using [LogoMakr](https://logomakr.com/).  It is a great site!

##Font Pairings
Google Fonts were used for this application.  The two styles used were: Caveat Brush(Headers) and Montserrat (inputs, buttons).
